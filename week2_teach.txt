First, I based the hilo program in the dice game.

One of the first things was to think how to design the game and what things could be use as a class. I saw that the card could be a class. For this class I create the Card() class with the value attribute. The roll() method will generate a random number between 1 and 13 that will provide the value por the card. This class could be use anytime in the game and it is an advantage of the use of abstraccion.

Also the program has a Director() class that contains the attributes of the program, card, nextcard, is_playing, answer and score. The process was divided the game in their aspect and in little functions. Make little task to create the greater one. The director generate a loop in the game to play it. The start_game() function will call every part of the game with a different function.
